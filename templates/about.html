  <h1>About SyncWave</h1>

  <p>
    SyncWave is a mood-driven music discovery web app that adapts recommendations
    based on how you feel over time.
  </p>

  <p>
    Instead of static playlists, SyncWave tracks listening behavior,
    analyzes recent activity, and gently shifts recommendations to match
    your emotional patterns.
  </p>

  <p>
    All data is stored locally in your browser.
    No accounts, no tracking, no data collection.
  </p>

  <p>
    Built by Aryaman & Arshiya as a full-stack project using Flask,
    vanilla JavaScript, and modern UI principles.
